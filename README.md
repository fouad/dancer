Dancer
====

Sweet audio visualizer for parties/events. A bit more fun by including environment sounds too.

Dancer uses `getUserMedia` to grab the audio stream from the OS microphone then analyzes based on frequency/gain to render a canvas animation.

### Visualizations:

- Simple bars (2D)

A lot more coming...

### Install

Make sure you have [Dart Editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/).

Clone this repo and open in Dart Editor, then just build/run `index.html`.
